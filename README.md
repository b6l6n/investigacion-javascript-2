<h1>üñêÔ∏è Hi! we're Thais, Igor, Belen, Azalfa and Nay</h1>

<h2>üöÄABOUT </h2>

We have successfully taken the next steps in learning and applying JavaScript through this second research project.

Building on our prior knowledge, we have delved deeper into the subject, expanding our understanding of key concepts such as advanced functions, event handling, and dynamic interactions.
Additionally, we have explored intervals, error handling, and comparators, gaining valuable insights into these important aspects of JavaScript programming.

Moreover, we have further highlighted the importance of clean syntax and efficient coding practices, ensuring that our work remains both functional and maintainable.

This extended effort provides a solid foundation for more advanced exploration into JavaScript development and the application of best practices in programming.

<h2>‚ùìSTEPS</h2>
  <p>
    
  **Information Research**
    
    Each participant conducted research to gather relevant resources and documentation on JavaScript fundamentals, including variables, functions, and predefined methods.
    This phase was crucial for building a theoretical foundation and identifying reliable sources for further exploration.
    
  **Web-Based Exercises**
  
    To apply the knowledge acquired during the research phase, we engaged in interactive web-based exercises.
    These exercises allowed us to practice coding concepts in a hands-on environment, reinforcing understanding and improving problem-solving skills.
  
  **Collaborative Code Sharing**
  
    After completing individual exercises, we shared and reviewed our code as a group.
    This collaborative approach enabled us to compare solutions, discuss best practices, and refine our work through constructive feedback.
  
  **Synthesis and Documentation**
  
    Finally, we consolidated the insights gained from the previous steps into a cohesive code sheet.
    This document serves as a reference for variables, functions, methods, and proper syntax, ensuring a clear and comprehensive summary of our progress.

  **Extra**
  
    Additionally, we have developed a few interactive games to enhance our understanding and reinforce the concepts explored during our research.</p>
